        <h1>History of the Eiffel Tower</h1>
        <p>The Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, was built in Paris, France, for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world fair held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Named after its designer, the engineer Gustave Eiffel, the tower was originally criticized by some of Parisâ€™s leading artists and intellectuals for its unusual design. However, it quickly became a beloved symbol of modern engineering and innovation.</p>
