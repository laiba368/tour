        <h>Taj Mahal</h>
        <p>The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most iconic and beautiful monuments in the world. It was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. Construction began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, taking over 20 years to finish. The Taj Mahal is an exquisite example of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Ottoman, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. It is primarily made of white marble and features intricate carvings, calligraphy, and inlaid precious stones, creating a stunning visual masterpiece. The monument is surrounded by lush gardens, a reflecting pool, and a mosque, adding to its serene and majestic atmosphere.

            The Taj Mahalâ€™s architectural design is a symbol of love and loss, capturing the eternal bond between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. Over the centuries, the monument has become a UNESCO World Heritage site and a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors from around the world. Its beauty has inspired poets, artists, and filmmakers, making it a cultural symbol of India. Despite facing threats from pollution and natural disasters, the Taj Mahal continues to stand as a testament to the grandeur of the Mughal Empire and remains an enduring symbol of love, devotion, and architectural brilliance.</p>
