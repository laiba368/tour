        <h>The Great Pyramid</h>
        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops, is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one still largely intact. It was built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, around 2580â€“2560 BCE, under the reign of Pharaoh Khufu. The pyramid was originally 146.6 meters (481 feet) tall but now stands at approximately 138.8 meters (455 feet) due to the loss of its outer casing stones. It was constructed using an estimated 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, and its precision and sheer scale continue to astonish modern engineers and archaeologists. The purpose of the pyramid was to serve as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, a central figure in the ancient Egyptian belief in the afterlife, ensuring his journey to the next world.
