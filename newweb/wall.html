        <h>Great Wall China</h>
        <p>The Great Wall of China, one of the world's most famous structures, was initially built to protect Chinese states and empires from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE, with various sections built and connected over centuries, primarily during the Qin (221–206 BCE) and Ming (1368–1644 CE) dynasties. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles, crossing mountains, deserts, and plains, and is a testament to ancient China’s engineering capabilities and military strength. Beyond defense, the Great Wall also served to regulate trade along the Silk Road, allowing China to control commerce and cultural exchanges.</p>
